1720530_1,,,,,,,+1 for the patch.
1720530_2,,,,,,,Committed to trunk.
1720530_3,,,,,,,Thanks Arpit!
1191390_1,,,,,,,I think your logic is right.
1191390_2,,,,,,,This is what I understand.
1191390_3,,,,,,,1
1191390_4,,,,,,,FileSystemView is the user file system view so it can have canDelete() and canRead() methods ..... this is fine.
1191390_5,,,,,,,2
1191390_6,,,,,,,FileSystemView can have user object to indicate whose file system view it is representing.
1191390_7,,,,,,,3
1191390_8,,,,,,,"In that case, caching will be at the FileSystemView level (not at FileObject level)."
1191390_9,,,,,,,Logically this is also fine.
1191390_10,,,,,,,NativeFileSystemView represents the underlying OS file system view - no more no less.
1191390_11,,,,,,,Caching is a specialized function.
1191390_12,,,,,,,So if necessary we can add another FileSystemManager implementation which will support caching.
1191390_13,,,,,,,But it may not be appropriate to add this in NativeFileSystem classes.
1191390_14,,,,,,,"So the action items:
1. canDelete(), canRead() and canWrite() will be moved to FileSystemView from FileObject.

2065257_1,,,,,,,Applied the patch to implement Workspace.move
234857_1,,,,,,,We pretty much already had the interface we wanted for this (IFixedLocationResourceStream).

234857_3,,,,,,,"And then MarkupCache uses that interface to checkout what the actual file is

1423534_1,,x,,,,,"Hi Suran,

The new catalogs_b.patch looks very good."
1423534_2,,,,,,,It will need another round or two of adjusting but it is definitely looking solid.
1423534_3,,,,,,,I have applied the patch and am running regression tests now.
1423534_4,,,,,,,I will post my results when the tests finish.
1423534_5,,,,,,,"I have some comments on the new patch:

PermDescriptor

o You should remove the permUUID field from this class since it shadows the oid field in the superclass."
1423534_6,,,,,,,"In my experience, this kind of shadowing always causes bugs in the future because it is so easy to lose track of which copy of the redundant field is being used."
1423534_7,,,,,,,"So the constructor for this class should call setUUID( permUUID ) rather than stuffing the shadowing field via ""this.permUUID = permUUID""."
1423534_8,,,,,,,"o Once you do that, you can get rid of the getUUID(), setUUID(), and getObjectID() methods in this class."
1423534_9,,,,,,,o I have reservations about the second constructor for this class (the one which is used to create a key descriptor rather than a full-fledged permissions descriptor).
1423534_10,,,,,,,"However, I see that you are following the data dictionary patterns for the other permissions descriptors."
1423534_11,,,,,,,I think you are right to follow the existing patterns.
1423534_12,,,,,,,But we should put a sticky note on our brains to remind ourselves to clean up this pattern in the future--partially initialized data is brittle.
1423534_13,,,,,,,This is something we can revisit when we collapse all of the permissions catalogs into the master catalog which you are creating.
1423534_14,,,,,,,"Don't worry, that's another project and not part of the sequence generator work."
1423534_15,,,,,,,"SYSSEQUENCESRowFactory

o I think that you should flip the order of the keys in the second index."
1423534_16,,,,,,,"That is, the key order should be ( schemaID, sequenceName ) rather than ( sequenceName, schemaID )."
1423534_17,,,,,,,This will speed up the check in DataDictionaryImpl.isSchemaEmpty().
1423534_18,,,,,,,"But maybe you have a use for an index with key order ( sequenceName, schemaID ) which I'm not seeing."
1423534_19,,,,,,,"If so, then I would recommend adding a third index."
1423534_20,,,,,,,"Note that if you swap the key order, then you will need to make a corresponding change to DataDictionaryImpl.getSequenceDescriptor(String, SchemaDescriptor)


o I think that buildColumnList() should return an array of 10 column descriptors, one for each column in the table."
1423534_21,,,,,,,"See, for instance, the corresponding method in SYSALIASESRowFactory."
1423534_22,,,,,,,"SYSROLESRowFactory

o As with SYSSEQUENCESRowFactory, I think that buildColumnList() should return a larger array, one cell for each column in the table."
1423534_23,,,,,,,"DataDictionary

o The header comment for getPermDescriptor() does not seem to describe the method."
1423534_24,,,,,,,"EmptyDictionary

o I think that you can remove the stub for dropSequenceDescriptor(String, TransactionController) because you have removed this method from the DataDictionary interface."
1423534_25,,,,,,,"DataDictionaryImpl

o The header comments on getUncachedPermDescriptor() getPermDescriptor(), and dropAllPermDescriptors() look like they were copied from pre-existing methods, so they should be revised to describe the new methods."

480162_1,,,,,,,It looks like the problem originates in PDFBOX-11.
480162_2,,,,,,,"Many CID mappings are expressed as ranges, which the code explodes into individual Integer->String pairs."
480162_3,,,,,,,This causes pretty big data structures as many of our CMaps cover 65k possible mappings!
480162_4,,,,,,,We should use a more efficient in-memory representation for such range mappings.

766227_1,,,,,,,Patch applied in trunk.
766227_2,,,,,,,I have added some buttons to help put variables and patterns.
766227_3,,,,,,,Thank you for your contribution.
1633444_1,,,,,,,"applies to trunk, too"
1114706_2,,,,,,,"Also #3 seems to be fairly simple with a single ""around"" advice in aspectj and a couple of lines for ajc target in build.xml."

1114706_4,,,,,,,You can do this for info messages too for more performance when that is off.
1114706_5,,,,,,,There are no extra lines of code or maintenance; it is the simplest solution.
1114706_6,,,,,,,"As long as the change is applied at build time, I don't see any real drawback.

360149_1,,,,,,,"Ah, ok ... thanks for the heads up."
360149_2,,,,,,,"There's a note on the main page about these scripts, but you're right: nothing obvious in some of hte ""sub pages""

1427702_1,,,,,,,"Changes to the test look good, and your method for finding which are right/wrong is correct."
1427702_2,,,,,,,I would advise that a good thing to do once you have fixed this issue is to then perform a similar test modification for setting a valid value and using batching.
1673444_1,,,,,,,I've started to work towards support for visualising services and cascading configuration.
1673444_2,,,,,,,The changes in this patch aren't a complete solution but they're free-standing give basic service visualisation and shared configuration support.
1673444_3,,,,,,,I've introduced a decorator framework for relationships so we can draw the service triangles (or package names).
1673444_4,,,,,,,The service handling will need to be updated slightly once we're not working from the DummyInfoProvider.
1673444_5,,,,,,,Handling of services which aren't consumed and services which are consumed by multiple bundles is pretty weak.
1673444_6,,,,,,,I've also started to add cascading configuration.
1673444_7,,,,,,,I've added a Theme class and a ComponentAppearance class which takes defaults from the theme and allows them to be over-ridden.
1673444_8,,,,,,,ComponentAppearances will also inherit from one another when we have nested components (like a bundle inside an application).
1673444_9,,,,,,,"I've only switched the ComponentColorElement (which was the ComponentColorProperty) over to use the new configuration so far, but I'll switch the other elements over to using the new configuration next."
1673444_10,,,,,,,"In the new version, elements have two methods - render(), which draws them, and apply() which 
initialises shared properties like colour."
1673444_11,,,,,,,This allows for a two-phase rendering.

1984725_2,,,,,,,"The file has Unix line endings though ...

@Lukas: scpexe works for me with M2 despite the fact that it insists on a key even if an agent is running (WAGON-27)."
677027_1,,x,,,,,"bq. OK w/ the latest patch all tests pass for me! Great 
Awesome! :)"
2113606_1,,,,,,,Do the same tests work fine on 1.5.0dev?
2113606_2,,,,,,,"One of the things I changed in jnr-posix, was to make stat and fstat use stati64 and fstati64 respectively, instead of stat64 and fstat - the last may be why its breaking with jna-posix."
2113606_3,,,,,,,"Look in WindowsLibCFunctionMapper.java for the fstat mapping - it may all magically work if you change fstat to map to _fstat64 (note: no 'i' in the name - uses stat64 struct instead of stati64 ... they have different sized atime, ctime, mtime fields)."
2113606_4,,,,,,,"Otherwise, the WindowsFileStat structure looks ok, apart from the st_blocks and st_blksize fields at the end, which are not part of the windows stat64 struct, so will probably be filled with either zero, or garbage.

1540427_6,,,,,,,1: The skipBloomFilters gets called on the index file in RowIndexEntry line 104.
1540427_7,,,,,,,"2: In 2.0, the skipBloomFilters will be called on a 1.2 sstable; also, the skipBloomFilters currently is called against any sstable when scrubbing."
