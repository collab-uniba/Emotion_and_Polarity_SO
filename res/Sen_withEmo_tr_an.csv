  First of all, anyone upgrading should examine CHANGES.txt which would certainly have a note on this explicitly in the upgrading section of that document."
367902_2,,,,,,,"Secondly, most point-release upgrades people do are ones in which the config stays the same."
367902_3,,,x,,,,"Thirdly, the scenario you present in which someone copies a subset of their 3.5 schema would only error if that person ALSO chose to omit the defaultSearchField declaration -- but why would they do that?"
367902_4,,,,,,,"Besides, I don't think there should be any expectation of ""it'll just work"" if you copy some arbitrary subset of an old schema into a new example config."
367902_6,,,,,,,"If that's true, it'd be nice if we had a standard way to annotate such code so we can methodically remove the old stuff."
367902_7,,,,,,,"""@deprecated"" isn't enough because it's just at the method/class level, not an internal if branch."
369046_1,,,,,,,"{quote}
you lost me there ... they can use the exact same configs – that's kind of the point: testing the exact example configs as we ship them (with <lib/> declarations that point at dirs which may or may not contain jars depending on what contribs are built; and request handler / response writer declarations configured that use lazyloading to dynamic load things as needed."
371904_1,,,,,,,Ah - i jumped the gun on you.
371904_10,,,,,,,This has been the history of Lucene and the thing about the project that I admired most - heavy hands where checked at the door.
371904_11,,,,,,,"I'm no angel, and I'm not perfect about this myself."
371904_12,,,,,,,But I still try and police it because I think its important.
371904_2,x,,,,,,That is useful advice (call me biased if you'd like).
371904_3,,,,,x,,"Honestly, there is no way around this issue - of course we must discuss and come to some solution regarding Lucene/Solr at this point."
371904_6,,,,,x,,"In the past, I have enjoyed working with everyone here."
371904_7,,,,,,,My personal beef in this issue is not with that though - I simply am very offended by heavy handed reverts and such.
371904_8,,,,,,,I feel the same way about JIRA.
371904_9,,,,,,,Words before action in my book - many words - hard as that can be for all of us sometimes.

579540_2,,,,,,,That's why I need to ask questions now when I want to understand the current logic (as it is not logical for me).
579540_4,,,,,,,If I put my hands in the code to fix stuff myself I will probably introduce something that is illogical for you (e.g.
579540_5,,,,,,,"the logical solution to me was to add the methods to the interface) so I guess I did the right thing opening this bug and asking for your opinion and I can't accept your ""for the sake of sweet Jesus"" in reply."

740211_1,,,x,,,,How should integer division work for decimals and floating point?
