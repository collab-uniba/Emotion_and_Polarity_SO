Employee3 x Dept1.employess=Employee3

I don't like this sintax since it changes an obvious behaviour, IMO."

1411121_1,,,,,,,"Here's another crack at this:

1) The default behavior for Derby is the current behavior with all of its security holes for java routines."
1411121_2,,,,,,,"2) To get secure behavior for java routines, the customer has to explicitly opt-in."
1411121_3,,,,,,,Let's be vague about what that entails right now.
1411121_4,,,,,,,"3) If you do opt-in, then you get the SQL standard behavior:

   3a) Jar ids are mandatory."
1411121_6,,,,,,,"Instead, to access methods in the JRE you have to include little wrapper methods in your jar files that you loaded into the database."
1411121_7,,,,,,,3c) The search order for customer-written routines is SQL standard: First we look in the jar file where the routine lives.
1411121_8,,,,,,,Then we look in the other jar files in the order specified by SQLJ.ALTER_JAVA_PATH.
1411121_9,,,,,,,Then we defer to the system class loader.
1411121_10,,,,,,,"3d) At runtime, when we invoke the routine, we make sure that it actually lives in the declared jar file.

389675_5,,,,,,,"But not very helpful at the sizes you are working with (and not settings I would use to save RAM anyway, unless the amount I need to save was pretty small)."
389675_6,,,,,,,"Also, the savings are largely index side - not likely a huge part of your RAM concerns, which are search side."
389675_8,,,,,,,"My filterCache stats are great- you know it's set to 64K but right now, with almost all the RAM used up (we're at 71.9% now), but it's only using 36290 entries at the moment and it's holding pretty steady there(even as RAM usage increased by 10%)."
389675_9,,,,,,,None of the other caches have gone up much either.
389675_10,,,,,,,"We have no cache evictions, at all, but a 99% hit ratio."
389675_11,,,,,,,The sizes may be higher than you need then.
389675_12,,,,,,,They should be adjusted to the best settings based on the wiki info.
389675_13,,,,,,,"I was originally suggesting you might sacrifice speed with the caches for RAM - but, its always best to use the best settings and have the necessary RAM."
1171432_1,,,,,x,,Yes exactly -- sorry to be so unclear.
1171432_2,,,,,,,Just really wondering/hoping you'd be interested in working on these ??
1171432_3,,,,,,,I'd like to get them cleaned up because there are now so many that other more important and/or meaningful warnings are likely to be ignored.

1379857_1,,,,,,,Commited a fix for this into trunk using revision 610846.

Collator object is already available in the territory sensitive character classes and we
do not have to go to database context to get it."
1379857_5,,,,,,,"I changed the code to use that collator

1379857_6,,,,,,,"The reason for null pointer exception was 
that database context was not loaded yet during database recovery."

675071_4,,,,,,,"I think WordDelimiterFilter has special code that might avoid the problem (line 352), so it might

1563411_5,,,,,,,"Kind of odd behavior, although I guess it's technically within-spec.)"
1563411_7,,,,,,,IncomingStreamReader does clean the tmp file when there is an expection (there's an enclosing 'try catch').
1563411_8,,,,,,,The problem is that no exception is raised if the other side of the connection dies.
1563411_9,,,,,,,What will happen then is the read will infinitely read 0 bytes.
1563411_10,,,,,,,"So this actually avoid the infinite loop returning 0 (and so I think answered your second question, so it wasn't very clear)."
1563411_11,,,,,,,"Note that without this patch, there is an infinite loop that will hold a socket open forever (and consume cpu, though very few probably in that case)."
1563411_12,,,,,,,So this is not just merely a fix of deleting the tmp files.

I'm confused by this."
698238_2,,,,,,,"My assumption is that, when you make a request to read 1k from a disk file, that the OS reads substantially more than 1k from the disk and places it in the buffer cache."
698238_3,,,,,,,(The cost of randomly reading 1k is nearly the same as randomly reading 100k--both are dominated by seek.)
698238_4,,,,,,,"So, if you make another request to read 1k shortly thereafter you'll get it from the buffer cache and the incremental cost will be that of making a system call."
698238_5,,,,,,,"In general, one should thus rely on the buffer cache and read-ahead, and make input buffers only big enough so that system call overhead is insignificant."
698238_6,,,,,,,"An alternate strategy is to not trust the buffer cache and read-ahead, but rather to make your buffers large enough so that transfer time dominates seeks."
698238_7,,,,,,,"This can require 1MB or larger buffers, so isn't always practical."
698238_8,,,,,,,"So, back to your statement, a 1k buffer doesn't save physical i/o, but nor should it incur extra physical i/o."
698238_9,,,,,,,"It does incur extra system calls, but uses less memory, which is a tradeoff."

1697610_1,,,,,,,Ran for almost an hour this time.
1697610_2,,,,,,,Dump looks similar to previous one.
473519_1,,,,,,,Here's another whack at splitting the patch.
473519_2,,,,,,,"I addressed Shravan's request to add in the MRStreaming stuff into LocalLauncher, and put in the jc.stop() calls after failed jobs in both Local and MapReduceLauncher."
934597_2,,,,,,,"...and it seems like having 2 APIs, KV and Cell, for every method other than those that take Cell-types params..."
934597_3,,,,,,,Which methods we talking about here?
934597_4,,,,,,,There a list?
149095_1,x,,,,,,Thanks Pat.
149095_2,x,,,,,,Patch looks good to me.
149095_3,,,,,,,Ill go ahead and push it.
1415798_2,,x,,,,,I like this title.
1415798_3,,,,,,,It is specific to what it is describing.
1415798_4,,x,,,,,Thanks.
544990_2,,,,,,,Couldn't the NodeState implementations in question (StoreNodeAsState AFAICS) just use their id to implement hashCode()?
544990_3,,x,,,,,"indeed, good catch!"
781677_1,,,,,,,"<joes4> This is a bug in FreeBSD's ldap support- sorry there's nothing we can do about it.

Go ahead."

728458_1,,,,,,,Thanks for patch v2.
728458_2,,,,,,,"Some comments:
20."
728458_3,,,,,,,Log.truncateTo(): The following code seems to be used just for getting the first segment.
728458_8,,,,,,,22
728458_9,,,,,,,"ReplicaManager:
22.1 recordLeaderLogUpdate(): Could we rename it to recordLeaderLogEndOffset()?"
728458_10,,,,,,,22.2 close(): Could we rename it to shutdown to map startup()?
728458_11,,,,,,,22.3 readCheckpointedHighWatermark(): We should just read the HW from memory.
728458_12,,,,,,,The on-disk version is only useful on broker startup when we populate the in-memory HW using the on disk version.
728458_13,,,,,,,23
728458_14,,,,,,,"HighwaterMarkCheckpoint: Is it better to name the file "".highwaterMark"" so that it's hidden?
"
1046439_1,,,,,,,I applied the patch at revision: 599008.
1046439_2,,,,,,,"Still, why do we hardcode these numbers, e.g."
1046439_3,,,,,,,"port/src/lil/em64t/pim/m2n_em64t_internal.h:
#ifdef _WIN64
const unsigned m2n_sizeof_m2n_frame = 120;
#else
const unsigned m2n_sizeof_m2n_frame = 104;
#endif

vmcore/src/util/em64t/base/compile_em64t.cpp:
// Stack size should be (% 8 == 0) but shouldn't be (% 16 == 0)
const int ALIGNMENT = 0;

Doesn't it worth to let compiler calculate such values? "
924133_1,,,,,,,It would be good if folks can use standard Java i/o idioms with Hadoop.
924133_2,,,,,,,"http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jtp03216.html

{noformat}
OutputStream out = fs.open(...);
try {
  out.write(...);
} finally {
  out.close();
}
{noformat}

When multiple files are involved the best thing is to nest the try blocks."
924133_3,,,,,,,"Shouldn't we try to make this idiom work well with HDFS?
"
1123551_1,,,,,,,"This looks good, but I wish there was a good way to set up a test case."
1123551_2,,,,,,,I guess the best way would be to create a JobTracker and call the heartbeat method and observe the requested heartbeat interval.
870799_1,,,,,,,I included the gen stamp and length in the {{cacheReport}} to handle caching newly appended data.
870799_2,,,,,,,"I guess the gen stamp is unnecessary, but the DN isn't going to automatically mlock newly appended data, so the NN needs to somehow realize that the cached length is shorter than the new length and ask the DN to recache at the new length."
870799_3,,,,,,,"Alternatively, I guess the DN could automatically mlock appended data, but there are quota implications there."
870799_4,,,,,,,"On startup, I agree that we can skip cache reports until the cache is populated."
870799_5,,,,,,,I also agree that jittering doesn't matter as much if it's ticking on such a short time scale.
870799_6,,,,,,,I guess I could have cleaned this up rather than just changing the default cache report period like Colin asked.
870799_7,,,,,,,"However, since we want to eventually have both incremental and full reports, let's just ape how block reports work; don't jitter the incremental reports, but do jitter the start time for the full reports and afterwards tick at a regular interval."
870799_8,,,,,,,"Let's clean up all these issues in the incremental cache report JIRA (HDFS-5092); if this sounds good, I'll edit the JIRA description with these todo items."
597488_1,,,,,,,Uploaded a patch that fixes the comments and includes the test
1017255_1,,,,,,,Thanks for the review.
1017255_2,,,,,,,We used to do 'stopping'.
1017255_3,,,,,,,Smile.
1017255_4,,,,,,,Stopping' gets us closer to classic Lifecycle.
1017255_5,,,,,,,I think just needed for this at mo.
499702_1,,x,,,,,"That's a good point; we should make sure that it doesn't decrease performance for one of the database types, even if it increases it for Oracle (in which case, making it configurable in oozie-site.xml would be a good idea too).  "
161056_1,,,,,x,,"Sigh, I don't like this overall if can't reuse everywhere."
161056_2,,,,,x,,Sorry to let you lose a wild goose chase.
161056_3,,,,,x,,"You are going to kill me when I say this, but it seems like we should just commit your first patch."
161056_4,,,,,,,Because this neither-here-nor-there code-reuse seems not much useful.
161056_5,,,,,,,The original reason why i asked this is so that clients can seamlessly cross over like in MR between RM and AHS.
161056_6,,,,,,,But it seems like clients have to know which protocol they are talking to.
161056_7,,,,,x,,This half-reuse is more confusing for new devs who see this code for the first time.
305460_1,,,,,,,fully agree Christian!
305460_2,,,,,x,,"Sorry, probably a misunderstanding from my side...."
305460_3,,,,,,,"I refereed to the [^v1-enable-wall-werror.patch] which contains {{-Wall -Werror}} and I thought it sould be {{-Wall -Wextra}}

However, just add {{-Wall}}  to that patch makes absolutely sense and could be committed."
1091112_1,,,,,,,"Hi Nicholas, did you solve the issue?"
1091112_2,,,,,x,,I meet the same problem on Eclipse recently but haven't figured out how to get through.
534670_1,,,,,x,,"Sorry Chris,

I missed it, done !"
671238_1,,,,x,,,"I don't think there is any sense in this, who cares?"
671238_2,,,,x,,,"We reported this crash to Oracle in plenty of time, and the *worse* wrong-results bug has been open since May 13: http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7044738, but Oracle decided not to fix that, too.

1029207_1,,x,,,,,(@ddlatham: thats kinda funny that you wrote the linked-to article -- it was a random google search)
731731_1,,,,,,,"Thank you for the patch Shawn, can you also tell us what behavior you are seeing that is wrong?"
731731_2,,,,,,,Maybe you can paste a SOAP query example request and explain the wrong behavior and what it is you are expecting?

985890_1,,,,,,,Marking as dup of HBASE-5861 (You saw it first Andrew but Jon is going to work on this over in 5861..)
1192574_1,,,,,,,"Patch applied, Thank to Clay Leeds."
1192574_2,,,,,,,(BTW - The Idea to retrieve the Document Title is the best solution on my opinion.)
642162_1,,,,,,,"[~smarthi] When I apply this patch, the source code cannot be compiled."
642162_2,,,,,x,,One of the error is that hiddenActivations cannot be resolved.
642162_3,,,,,,,"Another error is that the class Functions.NEGATE is misspelled as Function.NEGATE.



"
770457_1,,,,,,,"If you have the opportunity to do it, go ahead."
770457_2,,,,,x,,"I'm very busy for the moment so I didn't know when I 'd be able to the change myself, so if you can, your contribution would be one more time really appreciated."
887647_1,,,,,x,,"Oh, I didn't consider one flow like after the edit log conversion, immediately #store failed."
887647_2,,,,,,,"Now again in the next trip of finalization, it will throw NodeExistsException, here it is really required to do the #store."
887647_3,,,,,x,,I misunderstood the case and sorry for the confusion.
887647_4,,,,,,,Patch looks good to me.
691111_1,,,,,,,I'm fine w/ not naming it Consumer - I agree it does not really consume it.
691111_2,,,,,,,"But if we go with PayloadMergeProcessor, we'll need PayloadMergeProcessorProvider and they become quite long names :)."
691111_3,,,,,,,"I was thinking PayloadProcessor and PayloadProcessorProvider (have cool acronyms to PP and PPP), but then people might get confused that it processes all payloads (maybe before they are even written the first time), while it is actually invoked only during segment merges.I was following the *Consumer pattern I saw all over the place w/ SegmentMerger, and thought that if someone ever reads SM code, it will swallow easily another *Consumer one ..."
691111_4,,,,,,,"So between PC, PMP and PP - I prefer PP - the documentation should clarify what it does."
691111_5,,,,,,,But I'm open for suggestions.
859894_1,,,,,,,"setting

859894_2,,,,,x,,"Aside from the job succeeding (it doesn't), what effect should I be able to measure (in order to see if this is doing anything)?"
1490049_1,,,,,,,"Abhinav, can you also attach cloud_usage db dump."
1490049_2,,,,,,,Need it to test the fix.
303437_1,,,,,,,I changed the ubuntu version too.
1063055_1,,,,,,,"By the way, getCanonicalPath() performs actual file access, may take long if drive is slow (e. g. Samba), may fail with exception if path is inaccessible at the moment (e. g. on network drive) etc."
1063055_2,,,,,,,"On the other hand, getAbsolutePath() is purely logical and doesn't need file system access.
"
682430_1,,,,,x,,You misunderstood the response: StopFilter indeed did not change.
682430_2,,,,,,,"The change is now that in Lucene 4.0 all Analyzers are required to reuse TokenStream instances, so the StopFilter is only produced only once in your application (when the Analyzer is created)."
440583_1,,,,,x,,You would need to implement session resume; thats a whole new can of worms.
1725946_2,,,,,,,Only the first of these is a failure.
1725946_3,,,,,,,This test pukes all over the place when the first test fails.
1725946_4,,,,,,,Some of the other test cases in this class failed because that constraint error occurred?
1725946_5,,,,,,,There were most definitely 21 test case failures.
783620_1,,,,,,,"<danielsh> Yes, any23.zones.apache.org is the jail's hostname, so use the IP it resolves to.

153824_1,,,,,,,ill upload a patch for 3.1 and 3.2 branch as soon as ZOOKEEPER-597 gets committed to those branches.
930778_1,,,,,,,"Yeah, seems safe."
930778_2,,,,x,,,And the current behavior is irritating.
930778_3,,,,,,,Will commit a bit later unless somebody beats me to it.
187595_1,,,,,,,"Hi Zeid,

I'll go ahead and commit your changes, but this one doesn't look right...I think it's a hold over 
from the Mac files."
187595_2,,,,,,,This symbol is not used for the Windows Netaccessor.
187595_3,,,,,,,Yeah?
187595_4,,,,,,,Please watch the source tree over the next several weeks before our next release.
187595_5,,,,,,,"There will 
probably be some additional file checks, so you'll need to patch the projects yet again."
190156_1,,,,,,,This is the bridge code minus the redundant bit.
151815_1,,,,,,,I would like that add that the problem is highly reproducible.
1667930_1,,,,,,,Looks great to me.
1667930_2,,,,,,,Thanks Doug.

1048263_1,,,,,,,"The reason of such big number of ""ByteArrayOutputStream;.write"" invokes is signed ext/bcprov.jar - it's manifest is read by byte."
1048263_2,,,,,,,If we put this jar to bootclasspath we'll have at least 5% performance boost on HWA application .
1048263_3,,,,,,,btw: maybe we should add this Jira's as subtasks to HARMONY-5277 ?

255981_2,,,,,,,I guessed UIMA_HOME/config but could be /lib
207922_1,,,,,,,"The only thing that the convention plugin does at request time, happens in org.apache.struts2.convention.ConventionUnknownHandler, the rest is just configuration loading on start up, you might want to put a breakpoint in handleUnknownAction, and see what is going on."

1574835_2,,,,,,,"I'm not forgetting it :) 

Did you forget it, or did I miss it somewhere?"
245930_1,,,,,x,,I was not aware of being required to call that method.
245930_2,,,,,,,Is it possible to do this when closing the input/outputstream aswell?
1019322_1,,,,,,,Thanks Mathias.
1019322_2,,,,,x,,This is a silly one.
1019322_3,,,,,,,Bringing into 0.90.0.

461111_1,,,,,x,,"Seems we didn't enforce an exec for sh, but we did for fs."
991251_1,,,,,,,"@Jon
Thanks for committing it."
991251_2,,,,,,,Anoop reminded me about this.
1061211_1,,,,,,,The failure of GdiplusStartup happened to because this function was called from a native method with RSP not aligned to 16 bytes.
1061211_2,,,,,,,"It is not well documented in MSDN, but it looks like RSP has to be always aligned to 16 bytes."
1061211_3,,,,,,,"Some functions don't require it, but some do."
1061211_4,,,,,,,"A patch was made to the interpreter to fix this in assembly code, so if a native method has an odd number of arguments, additional 8 bytes are skilled by RSP to align it to 16 bytes."
1061211_5,,,,,,,Patch applied at 514264.
1017845_2,,,,,,,So I am likely going to work on this soon.
1017845_3,,,,,,,What is the exact problem?
1017845_4,,,,,,,"If it would as simple as just recreating ReplicationZookeeper or using RecoverableZookeeper J-D would have probably just done it :)
"
1463502_1,,,,,,,"You forgot to mention the part where I said that I have absolutely no idea if MinSize is important for some other part of the code ;)

Also, it looks like if we add a check in couch_db:doc_flush_binaries/2 to see if we're not streaming an attachment of unknown length, and then pass that information to couch_stream:ensure_buffer/2 so that couch_stream can decide if it wants to allocate exactly the requested amount or some extra it'd solve the issue."
1463502_2,,,,,x,,"The patch should be relatively trivial, but like I said, I have no idea if there is other important stuff going on there or not."
242894_1,,,,,,,The two issues mentioned by Tom has been fixed.
242894_2,,,,,,,The new patch is the whirr-168-3.patch file.
1687798_1,,,,,,,32 bit ubuntu 12.10
1127250_1,,,,,,,Marking this for 0.18.4 and above since it's a deadlock.
1127250_2,,,,,,,The patch should work on all fair scheduler versions.
1494424_1,,,,,,,"This blocker/ critcal was created before July please review and resolve, we are approaching 4.2 code freeze in 7 days "

1093662_1,,,,,x,,"Hey, sorry I did not get back to you sooner."
1093662_2,,,,,x,,I found the (sad) attempt at a script you asked about and uploaded it to MAPREDUCE-4282.
1093662_3,,,,,,,"As I said on that thread, I'm in a compilers class right now and I thought I might make a more ""enlightened"" attempt using lex/yacc soon and see where that gets me, if no one else gets this done first."

916437_2,,,,,,,"In the case I mentioned in my above comment, we would not lose datanode heartbeats if we implement HDFS-1392."
916437_3,,,,,,,"On the other hand, if there is a true network partition, then NN will ""lose heartbeats"" from datanodes, because the datanodes cannot send messages to the NN."
916437_4,,,,,,,"In that case, the NN should delay creating a replication-storm in the hope that the network partition gets resolved soon."

246457_1,,,,,x,,"Sorry, should have commented on this much sooner."
246457_2,,,,,,,That seems to work for me - thanks!
1050678_1,,,,,,,The preliminary patch is attached.
1050678_2,,,,,x,,"It is not yet tested - I ran into strange build problems with APR.
"
1537965_1,,,,,x,,"Done, sorry for all the mess on a simple patch."
534574_1,,,,,,,"David,

I've done a little digging and have a question around:  OrderReadHelper.getOrderItemQuantityBd()

Firstly going back a while now this log:
    http://svn.ofbiz.org/viewcvs/trunk/components/order/src/org/ofbiz/order/order/OrderReadHelper.java?rev=4367&r1=4281&r2=4367
shows a change to the strings that seems to make the first if statement redundant?!"
534574_2,,,,,,,I presume either that statement can now be removed or the original intention of the statement needs reimplementing?
534574_3,,,,,x,,"Secondly reading this code I can see why this bug is happening, after completing stage 2 above when adding the new item the code does ""ordered - cancelled = quantity"" which equates to ""1 - 1 = 0""."
534574_4,,,,,x,,"Keep repeating this and the problem just gets worse.
"
1575383_1,,,,,,,"scheduleAtFixedRate ""Creates and executes a periodic action that becomes enabled first after the given initial delay, and subsequently with the given period; that is executions will commence after initialDelay then initialDelay+period, then initialDelay + 2 * period, and so on."
1575383_2,,,,,,,"If any execution of the task encounters an exception, subsequent executions are suppressed...""

so get() shouldn't be causing a cancel, but if an exception is found then we need to re-schedule it manually."
1575383_3,,,,,,,(If you cast the Runnable in afterExecute to ScheduledFutureTask you can get access to the scheduling info.)
1575383_4,,,,,,,if get is causing the cancel even w/o any exceptions being involved then I guess you'll need to source dive in ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor to see what is going on.
405295_1,,,,,,,"Here are two thread dumps:

sling6.thread_dump.01.txt was taken about 10 seconds after a shutdown of Sling was attempted."
405295_2,,,,,,,sling6.thread_dump.02.txt was taken a couple minutes later.
405295_3,,,,,,,I include it because quite a few of the threads from the first dump have stopped by this point.
1098209_1,,,,,,,"thx todd, missed the ant/ivy stuff, update patch takes care of it (hopefully mavenized gridmix goes in soon and ant/ivy will go away)"
1473227_1,,,,,x,,Please ignore attachment (id=6938).
1473227_2,,,,,x,,It was attached to the wrong bug.
581209_1,,,,,,,According to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-6336 we can't use git for websites.
401935_1,,,,,,,"Thanks for the reference, I'll look into it."
401935_2,,,,,,,[~egli] - can you reproduce?
401935_3,,,,,,,"If you do, you'd stand a better chance of making a proper fix..."
564075_1,,,,,x,,"(back from holidays, so a bit delayed, but) I confirm Andrzej's suggestion -- a plain-text only summarized is ideal for clustering for example."
564075_2,,,,,x,,HTML is quite uncomfortable to work with.

1326729_2,,,,,,,"It would be great, if you could work on it."
1326729_3,,,,,,,Thus assigning the issue to you.
1326729_4,,,,,,,Thanks.
528962_1,,,,,x,,"Hi Marco,

I changed the name of patch because it was made in Java earliar, sorry for inconvenience."
528962_2,,,,,,,"I have uploaded the modified patch ""PartyCommunication.patch"" and it is ready for testing.
"
1672977_1,,,,,,,"This is the reverse side of ARIES 399, which dealt with a deadlock in ServiceRecipe."
1672977_2,,,,,,,"As mentioned there to fix the issues blueprint code that calls out to any kind of client code (reference listeners, service listeners, initialiser methods) should not hold the full BlueprintRepository lock, which allows deadlocks like the two observed."
1672977_3,,,,,,,Or at least the locks need to be much more fine-grained than locking the whole container.
1672977_4,,,,,,,I hope the first approach as the more general solution will work though :)
1702071_1,,,,,,,"Yeah I had a hunch it was a shutdown hook, kicking in at the same time."
1552294_1,,,,,,,"i modified the test class from HADOOP-6148 (bigger is better)
the result is:

1500398_1,,,,,,,I fixed the build failures on 4.1 this morning.
1500398_3,,,,,,,I'm doing an automated test as well.

870881_2,,,,,,,Add the time of last heartbeat to dead server Web UI.
1173673_1,,,,,,,The patch should be licensed to ASF for inclusion in ASF works.
1173673_2,,,,,x,,Sorry for the mistake.
460954_1,,,,,x,,Not sure I want the transient inability to clean up some local log or other trivial task to kill a whole pig job?
1537801_1,,,,,x,,First guess: something's getting confused about reversed-ness.
1537801_2,,,,,,,Is that part of the test in question?
547122_2,,,,,,,"lifecycle management up to a separate container

Agreed, and my patch also contains a TODO for that."
547122_3,,,,,,,"Similar to all other plugins, the life cycle hook should be pluggable in a sense that you can deploy them e.g."
547122_4,,,,,,,in an OSGi container as a separate bundle.
547122_5,,,,,,,Instead of hardcoding the hooks we could introduce a LifeCycleHookProvider similar to ValidatorProvider we already have.

646202_1,,,,,,,"

646202_2,,,,,,,Have you tried the standard maven untangling tricks like deleting ~/.m2?
1194263_1,,,,,,,We need to make this configurable before we can apply this patch to the trunk (unless i have misunderstood the effect).

1129306_2,,,,,,,"You could programatically set this before getting your filesystems, and when set true, the shutdown hook would not be added."
869031_1,,,,,,,"Vinay, thanks for working on this."

869031_4,,,,,,,"{code}

In the implementation in FSNamesystem, it should try-catch the UnresolvedLinkException and log it as an error since the full path obtained from a file should not have unresolved link."
869031_5,,,,,,,Second question: Why adding DFSTestUtil.abortStream(..)?
869031_6,,,,,x,,It does not look very useful.
639696_1,,,,,,,I appended the information to the end of the file.

1470935_2,,,,,x,,"Sorry, I had attached an older version... let's try this one."
1470935_3,,,,,,,I guess it's OK to put it in trunk.
1470935_4,,,,,,,I did not write it in a way that fits in with the rest of the implementations though.
1470935_5,,,,,,,No unit tests either yet.
1470935_6,,,,,x,,"However, I figured it was better to get it in the public domain sooner and let the iterative process do it's work."

1560034_1,,,,,x,,"Sorry, I kind of forget about this one."
1560034_2,,,,,,,I'm good with the last version of the patch of just adding a dclocal read repair chance.
1560034_3,,,,,,,Do you mind rebasing Vijay?
1014768_1,,,,,x,,I don't have strong opinions about it either way.
1014768_2,,,,,,,So I went ahead and made the change.
1014768_3,,,,,,,It's uploaded here and on review board.
160613_1,,,,,,,Removed version-infomation znode.

1665696_1,,,,,,,"I can see why, the test case just checks that the error string includes the exception text ""foo""."
1665696_2,,,,,x,,That is a bit too lax I think.
1665696_3,,,,,,,"The problem is not that the exception text is lost completely, it does come through, just that it is wrapped in an AvroRuntimeException(""Unknown datum type: ""+datum) error."
1665696_4,,,,,,,"So instead of the expected ""java.lang.RuntimeException: foo"" text being sent you get ""org.apache.avro.AvroRuntimeException: Unknown datum type: java.lang.RuntimeException: foo""."
1665696_5,,,,,x,,The cause is that the call to SpecificResponder.writeError in Responder.respond ultimately calls GenericData.resolveUnion which in turn calls GenericData.getSchemaName before the line where the UnresolvedUnionException gets thrown.
1665696_6,,,,,,,GenericData.getSchemaName instead throws an AvroRuntimeException so the special handling of UnresolvedUnionException in Responder.respond is skipped and the nested exception text is the result.

243701_3,,,,,x,,Sorry.
726893_1,,,,,,,Yeah we can do it in 0.8.1 which should happen fairly quickly after 0.8 but we are really trying to lock down 0.8 to critical fixes and this is more of a new feature (though obviously desirable).
