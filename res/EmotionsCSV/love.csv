6;Ok, I find the reason: device won't answer to simple user (and doesn't matter what permissions did you ask in program manifest). You can directly speak to device only if you are root (or from kernel mode). That means you cannot use devices directly from general applications. Very sad :(;NO

18;I have a long scrolling page, and want to test if an element is 100px from the top, then apply a class elsewhere (until the next element in line is 100px from the top) If I could just get the basic statement I would be ecstatic, anything extra would be a bonus!;YES
19;"I am working with Eclipse (Indigo) to develop C projects. When I create a new C project in a new workspace, by default the ""Autosave before build"" option is not set. This is extremely frustrating, as autosave is usually the default behavior in other IDE's I worked on. I change some code, build and nothing seems to go as expected - until I remember that the option is not set... Is there a way to make Eclipse open a new workspace with this option set?";NO

25;You can register any serializable type with the clipboard provider:;NO
26;Shoulld be:;NO
27;Firstly, that's not how works. You have to specify constants for each , and those constants will be compared to the expression in parentheses (in your case, ). That is how works, period. Secondly, switch is not faster than several s And thirdly, you shouldn't really worry about miniscule performance optimizations when you're dealing with javascript.;NO
28;Compare these two methods: Aside from the method signatures (bar can declare instead of ), is there any practical difference between the two methods? To be clear: I'm aware that this is a horrible approach to exception handling, and should not be done!;NO
29;Excellent! That makes life considerably easier. I really didn't want to add another layer to the application if I could avoid it. As far as StackOverflow etiquette goes, if I set this question as answered, Nikos won't get the rep for it as the answer is in the comments. What's the protocol?;YES

45;I have developed a cumulative sum function as defined below in the Haskell library Repa. However, I have run into an issue when combining this function with the transpose operation. All 3 of the following operations take well under a second: However, if I write: performance degrades horrendously. While each individual operation in isolation takes well under a second on a 1920x1080 image, when combined they now take 30+ seconds... Any ideas on what could be causing this? My gut tells me it has something to do with delayed arrays, not forcing at the right time, etc... But I do not have enough experience to track this down quite yet.;NO
46;@Mario I disagree, while the answer is outrageously awful, it's still an answer.;NO
47;Don't do that. Use instead. is a FIFO queue that lets you pass data around threads without worrying (much!) about locking semantics.;NO

50;If I have a setup project in a VS 2010 solution and I add/remove another project, or unload/reload another project any setup projects in the solution are expanded in the solution explorer. It only does this for setup projects and it is extremely annoying. Is there any way to disable this behaviour?;NO
51;sounds like desirable behaviour to me! How do you make it do that again?!?;NO
52;I am learning ML. Can some one please help me out with basic input/output functions in ML?? I just want to read input from console and store it in a variable and use it in my ML program. Please help. If you can point me towards some example for this also it would be super great!!! Thank you.;YES
53;"I appreciate your warm welcome, I never seen such a warm regard here for trying to be helpful, it was a really pleasant introduction and I want to thank you for taking your time to write - at last the end of the questions reads ""If anyone has any ideas I would be extremely grateful!""";YES

64;Unless you use JetBrains's excellent tools!;YES
65;My guess is that you would have to extend the classes for DataTip, to check for NULL hitData objects, to kill/stop the drawing of the display. I do not think there is a way to do that normally in FLEX. You would have to customize and override the hitData class unfortunately. What a pain!!;NO

75;I had a memory crash on UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext() ... if you're creating and releasing a lot of them, you should wrap them in a fresh AutoReleasePool for each iteration.

82;"Out of all that pseudocode, the only thing that really worries me is ""extracts code samples from file"". Reading files from a directory is trivial, saving a file is trivial. Regardless of the test framework I'd spend most of my time focusing on the parsing bit. For direct testing, I'd embed the snippets directly into the test case: Ah, I see another change I subtly made while writing the test: my ExamplesToCode.parse() returns an Array (or other iterable container), so that it can be tested apart from the iteration itself.";NO

The Controller should act and retrieve/update objects inside the Model, select an appropriate View and pass the information to it so it may display. Only crude and rudiementary PHP variables/simple if statements should appear inside the View. If the View gets the information it needs to display from the Model, surely there will be a lot of PHP inside the View -- completely violating the point of seperating presentation logic.;NO

44;So, the following hack seems to work, but it's really incredibly ugly IMO, as it relies on you controlling the line-height and using absolute positioning. Worse, it requires you to know how many lines there are in your text, which depends on the width of the div and the font-size, and probably requires JS to compute.Anyway, after all the above disclaimers, here's the hack: Use two divs with the same text, one on top of the other. One justified, one centered. Then clip the justified one.HTML CSS Fiddle.Of course, the above code is hard-coded for the specific width. Again, you'll probably need JS in order to compute the number of lines in the div.

In case you need you move to ZF2 be sure that ZF2 is not just an upper version of ZF1 but the whole Architecture is also changed.So, If you really need to move then 1.

I have tested by connecting to both IP and Socket, SSL and without, and it's just not usable as-is.

Maybe like reading all the entries from File 2 into a dictionary and then associated that entry with its matching entry in File 1 and use to extract the whole sequence...But I really don't know....Any help anyone could give me is extremely appreciated!;YES

Boost adds a significant compile time overhead, had tons of files to park into your repository (and to have to copy around/zip/extract if you are making an archive). That's the reason I try not to use it. I know you can choose what files to include/not include, but you usually don't want to have to worry about Boost's cross dependencies with itself so you just copy the whole thing around.;NO

9;At a guess, you're probably defining your objects in VB as just s, something like this: If so, you're forcing VB to go through the automation interface (IDispatch). Basically, it doesn't know what type you're going to assign to until run-time, so it has to invoke methods on that object via IDispatch::Invoke. To do that, it looks up all the information it needs for an invocation from the object itself at run time.By contrast, your C++ code is probably early-bound, which means offsets into the COM object's vtable are compiled directly into your code. In that case, when/if you change the code so those offsets aren't valid any more, the code will fail horribly.;NO

This means your fragment may or may not get destroyed. As you can see in your stack trace, FragmentActivity.onCreate is called.This obviously inddicates your existing resources created within the context of the old activity are not access - able anymore. The only context that is guaranted to exist through your application lifecycle is the application context.

30;I've been reading about MVC design for a while now and it seems officially the View calls objects and methods in the Model, builds and outputs a view. I think this is mainly wrong.
