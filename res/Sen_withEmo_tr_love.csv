I looked that the logic again I think your are right."
986573_2,,,,,,,When I did a quick glance last time I only saw the isolated patch and didn't see enough context to see the existing retry logic.
986573_3,,,,,,,(review board is helpful).
986573_4,,,,,,,Mind adding some comments explaining why this is ok to retry?
986573_5,,,,,,,(We are retrying once and if we fail twice we give up).
986573_6,,,,,,,It seems strange to me that we are retrying something that throws a DoNotRetyIOException.

This patch has been applied by chirino in the revision 576522  at Sep 17."
665434_1,,,,,,,"Hmmm... it's not collisions then, it was worth a try."
665434_2,,,,,,,I still find the difference puzzling -- I can't justify your version being 3x faster.
665434_5,,,,,,,"But we know a lot about docids, and extra hashing should just lead to an average-case slowdown."

762743_2,,,,,,,Have you got a link regarding the classpath exception and ASL2 compatibliity?
762743_3,,,,,,,"For the authentication issue, it's recorded in JAMES-1418 (I will try to look at it this weekend)."

376847_2,x,,,,,,This patch really helped.
376847_4,,,,,,,"So, I added a comment out on UnInvertedField."
583075_1,,,,,,,"For the second issue:
Consider long tailed distribution as shown on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail  (In case of network traffic."
583075_2,,,,,,,The biggest 90% data volume comes comes from less then 10% of connections.)
583075_3,,,,,,,In this case we have extremely wide spread __important__ values with only ___single_ occurrences.
583075_4,,,,,,,If we want to generate similar variable (for ex.
583075_5,,,,,,,larger sample) we'll get fixed values for all this bins in the long tail.
583075_6,,,,,,,It signifies 10% of generated values will be __fixed_ values - their respective bin means!
583075_7,,,,,,,Last Issue: I would question usage of Gaussian Kernel at all.
583075_8,,,,,,,"Without having a mathematical prove, I nevertheless suppose it could disturb parameters of generation if we have non Gaussian empirical data."
583075_9,,,,,,,(for ex.
583075_10,,,,,,,"Pareto, Tweedie, ..)

Why we don't stick with triangular or uniform distribution as default for Kernel within the bean?"
784774_1,,,,,,,"The apache vhost has been setup, but still needs some work."
784774_2,,,,,,,Right now it will proxy to port 80 of the httpd instance running on the current VM.
784774_3,,,,,,,Is this sufficient?
784774_4,,,,,,,Does nexus check for https connections for anything?
784774_5,,,,,,,Does it care at all?
1012858_1,,,,,,,"[~sershe], please bear with me - (1) could you please upload a rebased patch."
1012858_2,,,,,,,The patch is horribly out-of-date.
1012858_3,,,,,,,(2) HDFS-4979 introduced RetryCache in the NameNode.
1012858_4,,,,,,,Not sure if it is reasonable - is it possible to use the classes from HDFS-4979 here.
869647_1,,,,,,,Committed to branch.
775535_1,,,,,,,An email snafooey caused us to update our JIRA instance to 6.1 before we had a chance to test the import on our test instance (it didn't work properly for those who tried to whack at it).
775535_2,,,,,,,"We have a guy looking into getting it in shape now, but it will require you to update your current JIRA instance to 6.1 before doing another export for us."
775535_3,,,,,,,"I'm truly sorry for this inconvenience, but JIRA is really strict about the versions being equal when doing an import."
775535_4,,,,,,,"So, good news is we finally have a chance of testing the exports very soon, bad news is, it will require an update on your side to be able to transfer the spark JIRA data."
775535_5,,,,,,,"I hope you can figure out how to upgrade, and if you have any questions or need help, feel free to reach out to us."
857619_1,,,,,,,"Soundararajan, Ning - Yes I am planning on working on it starting next week."
857619_2,,,,,,,I expect this to take at least upto mid to late in the week in order to get a patch available for this.
857619_3,,,,,,,"However, if that schedule does not work for you, please feel free to take this issue into your queue and go ahead."
857619_4,x,,,,,,It will be great if you could confirm it either way first.
1070101_1,,,,,,,"Alexei, this patch is quite out of date (sorry about that)."
1070101_2,,,,,,,Please can you provide an updated patch?
1070101_3,,,,,,,"Thanks

1020899_4,,,,,,,"If regionnames were made of tablename+endrow instead of tablename+startrow, then in the metatables, doing a search for the region that contains the wanted row, we'd just have to open a scanner using passed row and the first row found by the scan would be that of the region we need (If offlined parent, we'd have to scan to the next row)."
1020899_5,,,,,,,"If we redid the meta tables in this format, we'd be using an access that is natural to hbase, a scan as opposed to the perverse, expensive getClosestRowBefore we currently have that has to walk backward in meta finding a containing region."
1020899_6,,,,,,,This issue is about changing the way we name regions.
1020899_7,,,,,,,"If we were using scans, prewarming client cache would be near costless (as opposed to what we'll currently have to do which is first a getClosestRowBefore and then a scan from the closestrowbefore forward)."
1020899_8,,,,,,,"Converting to the new method, we'd have to run a migration on startup changing the content in meta."
1020899_9,,,,,,,"Up to this, the randomid component of a region name has been the timestamp of region creation."
1020899_10,,,,,,,"HBASE-2531 ""32-bit encoding of regionnames waaaaaaayyyyy too susceptible to hash clashes"" proposes changing the randomid so that it contains actual name of the directory in the filesystem that hosts the region."
1020899_11,,,,,,,"If we had this in place, I think it would help with the migration to this new way of doing the meta because as is, the region name in fs is a hash of regionname... changing the format of the regionname would mean we generate a different hash... so we'd need hbase-2531 to be in place before we could do this change."
1406041_7,,,,,,,The two machines do not share the filesystem.
1406041_8,,,,,,,"There is an embedded Tomcat running in the same JVM, but according to the logs, the database is not booted twice."
1406041_9,,,,,,,"The only reasons for the failure I can think of were the failed network connections, the OutOfMemoryError or the 4000+ simultaneous connections together with lock timeouts."
1406041_10,,,,,,,"Ah and I am running 10.2 SVN 540841, as this fixes DERBY-2549."
877672_2,,,,,,,#NAME?
236726_1,,,,,,,Dojo [0] and Ext.js [1] take both a different approach (which i personally don't really like).

1110348_1,,,,,,,"Aaron:
I completely agree the parser needs to be changed, but I don't currently have the time available."
1110348_2,,,,,,,My goal here is a very small/quick change to revert how every FsShell command (except count) to how it used to work.
1110348_3,,,,,,,"If you're ok with that, I think another jira should switch the parser."
1110348_4,,,,,,,"Todd:
I suppose it comes down to whether hadoop should favor posix or gnu extensions?"
892816_1,x,,,,,,"Thanks Todd, glad to be on board!"
364570_2,,,,,,,can we apply the jarjar solution only to commons-csv?
476703_1,,,,,,,"I tested this again on Ubuntu 10.04,
This works with the new Tomcat instance and then when I tried the 2nd time it is not working."
476703_2,,,,,,,"But when i delete the file which was created at <tomcat-home>/bin/search-index/write.lock 
it works fine 
but I'm not sure whether this creates other implications?"
476703_3,,,,,,,Further I think the tags are not saved any ware because after redeploying I found the tags I added are missing.
476703_4,,,,,,,Is this due to the deletion of write.lock
639317_1,,,,,,,"From the logs, it is clear that the reducers could not fetch the output for map attempt attempt_200905051023_1155_m_000036."
639317_2,,,,,,,Both the reducers (and possibly everybody else) is waiting on these.
639317_4,,,,,,,There is something mysterious going on here.
639317_5,,,,,,,"If attempt id 1 was speculative, the framework would not have killed it as the original attempt was a failure."
639317_6,,,,,,,"If it was not, was the attempt Id 1 killed explicitly?"
639317_7,,,,,,,"In any case, why did not the framework try and re execute this map somewhere else?"
639317_8,,,,,,,Could you let us know if speculative execution was turned on?
639317_9,,,,,,,"If, by any chance, you have the logs for the task attempts attempt_200905051023_1155_m_000036_0 and attempt_200905051023_1155_m_000036_1, could you attach them to this Jira?

1116600_1,x,,,,,,"Owen, thanks for the slides."
1116600_2,,,,,,,"I don't see a direct relation between this issue and the issue of simplifying the implementation of efficient map-side joins (MAPREDUCE-1183, more or less)."
1116600_3,,,,,,,"Am I missing the connection, or is this a distinct issue?"
1116600_4,,,,,,,File formats are forever.
1116600_5,,,,,,,"More variations add significant, long-term compatibility burdens to the project."
1116600_6,,,,,,,We badly need to add support for a higher-level object serialization system than Writable.
1116600_7,,,,,,,But I'm not convinced its wise to add such support to the exisiting Java-only container file formats.
1116600_8,,,,,,,So I'm all for a more generic serialization API that can be used by MapReduce applications.
1116600_9,,,,,,,"I don't however see that it follows that we should provide implementations of file formats with a large number of different serialization systems, as that invites multiplicative long-term support issues."
1116600_10,,,,,,,I'd prefer that we instead direct users towards a single preferred high-level serialization system and a single preferred container.
1116600_11,,,,,,,Historically that's been Writable and SequenceFile.
1116600_12,,,,,,,"We now need to migrate from these to a more expressive, language-independent serialization system and container file."
1116600_13,,,,,,,"Our APIs should be of course be general enough that it's possible to incorporate different serialization systems and different file formats, but we needn't provide implementations of all combinations of these, but should rather direct folks towards a primary implementation."
1116600_14,,,,,,,Google benefits tremendously by having a single standard serialization system and container file format.
1116600_15,,,,,,,The Dremel paper (http://sergey.melnix.com/pub/melnik_VLDB10.pdf) argues that this is an essential enabler of their wide variety of interoperable systems.
1116600_16,,,,,,,The further we depart from this the harder we make it to build systems like Dremel that multiply the utility of stored data.
1116600_17,,,,,,,Changing serialization systems or file formats is a major imposition for many applications.
1116600_18,,,,,,,They cannot afford to do it frequently.
1116600_19,,,,,,,"We should provide a clear path forward from Writable+SequenceFile to a new system that's easier to use, less fragile, and language-independent to better facilitate a rich ecosystem of tools."

241962_1,,,,,,,How about fixing WHIRR-337 before?
241962_2,,,,,,,It should simplify things.
1017429_1,,,,,,,"+1, in my mind, the -ROOT- table is very important of routing the right RegionServer of .META."
1017429_2,,,,,,,The whole system could be out-of-service in case the Region of SequenceFile of the -ROOT- can NOT be opened.
1017429_3,,,,,,,"Thus, i quite agree that we put the .META."
1017429_4,,,,,,,directly into Zookeeper to reduce this.
1017429_5,,,,,,,We can avoid one case of failure.

694901_2,,,,,,,What would you think of just exposing incRef() & decRef() as expert public methods?
694901_3,,,,,,,#NAME?
694901_4,,,,,,,We would just add ensureOpen() to those methods and make them public.
237571_1,,,,,,,I don't agree to including the javadoc sources in the release.
237571_2,,,,,,,The zip is already large and contains all code.
237571_3,,,,,,,Using maven you can easily generate the docs yourself.
237571_4,,,,,,,Or even better: use the maven repository to automatically attach the sources-jar to your eclipse/idea/netbeans project.
237571_5,,,,,,,You can also download them by hand and attach them manually.
237571_6,,,,,,,The comparison with 1.2.6 is not valid as we use a different setup now and ship everyting in one zip instead of a zip per project..

1377264_1,,,,,,,"This patch adds the RelativeTest.java file which is a conversion of the jdbcapi/testRelative test, to the same package as the latter."
1377264_2,,,,,,,Also adds the tests to the _Suite class.
1377264_3,,,,,,,Please review and comment if anything is lacking or incorrect.
675068_1,,,,,,,Bulk close for 3.1
793394_1,,,,,,,Mailing Lists to be set up before this cab be done.
748448_1,,,,,,,"I've modified the patch to name the function rep.normalize

If you think that my proposal is actually not enough ambitious for being called ""normalization"", do you prefer something like rep:toASCII, which may seem less universal ?"
748448_2,,,,,,,"I really think there is an added value with this function for Jackrabbit users, I personnally use it with every String-ordered query."
489104_1,,,,,,,No - unfortunately I do not have enough knowledge to digg into OpenJPA's code
963946_1,,,,,,,That is correct.
1355422_1,,,,,,,The build seems to have broken on 10.9 when the test was backported.
1355422_2,,,,,,,It only breaks if j14lib is not set.
1355422_3,,,,,,,The problem is that I changed the build script to use java14compile.classpath instead of java15compile.classpath for the new test when I backported it from 10.10.
1355422_4,,,,,,,"I mistakenly thought 10.9 was supposed to work on Java 1.4 (in fact, the 10.9.1 release notes say it is supported, although we removed support for it after 10.8), and the build worked in my environment because I had j14lib set, and the test ran just fine on 1.4."
1355422_5,,,,,,,I'll post a patch that makes 10.9 compile the test against 1.5 instead of 1.4.
1355422_6,,,,,,,"The patch that broke the build on 10.9, was also backported to 10.8."
1355422_7,,,,,,,"However, on 10.8 it is correct to compile the test against 1.4, so that's not a problem."
589914_2,,,,,,,"Here are the results of testing the latest attachment 
  http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12605661/MAPREDUCE-5538.6.patch
  against trunk revision ."
589914_4,,,,,,,The patch does not contain any @author tags.
237274_1,,,,,,,I still can't work out how to do this.
237274_2,,,,,,,"Igor suggested moving the call to Component#onBeforeRenderChildren() inside Component#onBeforeRender(), but if I do that, I get an NPE in the ListView#renderItem() method even for basic code."
1068432_1,,,,,,,"Hmm, the suggested patch is not good for DRLVM, which handles ""-version"" normally."
1068432_2,,,,,,,"What is the point to print only launcher version, after all?"
715499_1,,,,,,,The following had serialVersionUID set for the 2.2 release.
715499_2,,,,,,,There have been no new ones added for 2.3.
715499_3,,,,,,,"So when 2.3 is released, you shouldn't get the problems you've had from 2.1 to 2.2 for these files."
282276_1,,,,,,,Committed patch with workaround in revisions 1054027 and 1054030
768049_1,,,,,,,"I attached our resolvers, sadly we have no file system resolvers, because our repository is hosted on a central server."
768049_2,,,,,,,Only the cache is a local filesystem resolver.
768049_3,,,,,,,"We are using this pattern ""${ivy.dir.pattern}/[revision]/[artifact]."
768049_4,,,,,,,"[ext]"" so we should fullfil the requirements for the atomic operation."
768049_5,,,,,,,Is it planned to add the atomic feature to all resolvers?
1035388_1,,,,,,,"I did some more messing around, and I was wrong about the FS stuff."
1035388_2,,,,,,,I deleted the local hbase directory and the problem went away.
1035388_3,,,,,,,Does this mean the migrate tool is busted for this version?
422798_1,,,,,,,Problem ensuing from source files inconsistency
355333_1,,,,,,,Patch with the fixes.
355333_2,,,,,,,Committing shortly.
1419726_1,,,,,,,Applying both patches results in clean tests (jdbc4 tests and derbyall modulo wisconsin noise).
1349886_1,x,,,,,,"Aha,, thanks for the information. That makes sense. Glad to hear that it helped! :)"
959742_1,,,,,,,Yeah that one (TestAtomicOperation) has me worried a bit.
959742_2,,,,,,,That one has not failed in a *very* long.
959742_3,,,,,,,And new we've had two failures within a few days.
1717560_1,,,,,,,Patch integrated to trunk.
658544_1,,,,,,,Closed after release.
1208441_1,,,,,,,Doc update to correct FQCN.
677770_2,,,,,,,"Simon, I'm going to get deletes working, tests passing using maps in the RT branch, then we can integrate."
677770_3,,,,,,,This'll probably be best.
677770_4,,,,,,,"Jason, I suggest you create a separate issue something like ""Integrate BytesRefHash in Realtime Branch"" and I will take care of it."
677770_5,,,,,,,I think this issue had a clear target to factor out the hash table out of TermsHashPerField and we should close it.
677770_6,,,,,,,lets use a new one to track the integration.
1417766_1,x,,,,,,Thanks for looking into this Suresh.
1417766_2,,,,,,,"Now, I can see this from the traces too."
1417766_3,,,,,,,We are re-using the prepared statement after table t1 is dropped.
285591_1,,,,,,,"Completed: At revision: 520469  
"
1472237_1,,,,,,,I believe this will be done only when the package name has to be changed due to backward incompatibilities.
526476_1,,,,,,,This is not new : we have the same type of behaviour when we switch languages...
1738716_1,,,,,,,Note: also change the use/effect of network connector dynamicOnly  - this flag had little effect but is now re-commissioned to indicate whether durable subs should be auto bridged (default) or whether they should be dynamic only.
1738716_2,,,,,,,There is no change to the default behavior.
428249_1,,,,,,,Fixed long ago.
428249_2,,,,,,,Deleting an entry now flushes the main page cache.
235124_1,,,,,,,"the link you point to is not our official javadoc

our official javadoc is in the maven repo."
235124_2,,,,,,,"if you want to view online there is a refreshed version here: wicketstuff.org/wicket13doc

for fragment see here

http://wicketstuff.org/wicket13doc/org/apache/wicket/markup/html/panel/Fragment.html"
1152183_1,,,,,,,I would like to get some early comments on the changes I have made to the Namenode to support restarting within the same JVM.
1152183_2,,,,,,,There are still some debugging prints that will go away in the final submission.
853658_1,,,,,,,"Oops, you're right, that makes sense."
853658_2,,,,,,,New patch that includes those changes.
1678342_2,,,,,,,"In the future, I could just get around the issue by using relative symlinks for those files (I think)."
938748_4,,,,,,,The patch does not contain any @author tags.
938748_6,,,,,,,The patch doesn't appear to include any new or modified tests.
938748_7,,,,,,,Please justify why no new tests are needed for this patch.
938748_8,,,,,,,Also please list what manual steps were performed to verify this patch.
938748_14,,,,,,,The javadoc tool did not generate any warning messages.
938748_16,,,,,,,The applied patch does not increase the total number of javac compiler warnings.
938748_18,,,,,,,The patch appears to introduce 1 new Findbugs (version 1.3.9) warnings.
938748_20,,,,,,,The applied patch does not increase the total number of release audit warnings.
938748_23,,,,,,,The mvn site goal succeeds with this patch.
938748_24,,,,,,,{color:green}+1 core tests{color}.
938748_25,,,,,,,The patch passed unit tests in .
1628828_1,,,,,,,Fxied and regression test written
694863_1,,,,,,,These 3 crashes happen while compiling DocumentWriter.invertDocument.
694863_2,,,,,,,It must be a bug in Sun's hotspot compiler.
694863_3,,,,,,,Has anyone opened an issue at http://bugs.sun.com yet?
694863_4,,,,,,,"That method, which inverts a single document, was replaced with new code starting with 2.3, so it's possible you can workaround the bug by upgrading to 2.3 or 2.4."
694863_5,,,,,,,But it'd still be nice to get the actual hotspot bug fixed.
715464_1,,,,,,,"How about following the naming from Math.min() and Math.max():
public static Date min(Date date1, Date date2);
public static Date max(Date date1, Date date2);

Alternatively, when I read 'Returnes [sic] the least recent (oldest)"", why not call the methods oldest() and newest()"
514698_1,,,,,,,"Improve patch : when the flexibleString is resolved, search fields on root context and parameters map."
1604507_1,,,,,,,"Yes, but even for Java 5 a relative path to a directory with flattened dependencies would be shorter, wouldn't it?"
997092_1,,,,,,,Committed to 0.92 and trunk.
1416147_1,,,,,,,And compatibility test also ....
736254_1,,,,,,,"Murray, that is exactly what I am proposing - having a separate org.apache.jspwiki.api -package, and placing a number of existing manager classes into it as interfaces."
736254_2,,,,,,,"Or to be precise, a mostly equivalent set of APIs; JCR requires some modifications which would make it complicated to support the existing set of APIs - mainly because we need to carry state information in a WikiContext, which the old API signatures do not mostly support."
736254_3,,,,,,,I would also like us to start using WikiNames wherever useful.
736254_4,,,,,,,"The idea behind this is largely the same as with our existing package structure - there is nothing technical in preventing *everything* to be in the org.apache.jspwiki -namespace (with no subpackages), but both aesthetics and experience tell us that it just makes sense to add subpackages to make class management easier."
736254_5,,,,,,,"In the same vein, isolating the API interfaces into a separate package makes it a lot easier to manage than having everything dispersed around - e.g."
736254_6,,,,,,,"if we want to create a jspwiki-api.jar, we only need to jar up the contents of a particular subdirectory."
736254_7,,,,,,,"If the developer wants to know whether he is using any possibly unstable components, all he needs to do is to glance at the set of import statements on the top - if he's using other classes than org.apache.jspwiki.api."
736254_8,,,,,,,"*, he knows that the classes are potentially unstable."
736254_9,,,,,,,"In addition, it makes the committer's life easier, since there is an agreement by convention that the APIs inside *.api are not to be touched without common agreement, whereas anything outside of this package can be treated with more liberties."
736254_10,,,,,,,We have so many people contributing in the code that API incompatibilities can creep in without anyone noticing.
736254_11,,,,,,,"(There is no PageManager at all; there is a ContentManager, which will have a very similar API, but it will manage both pages and attachments."
1356706_2,,,,,,,"What's the purpose of this line in the patch to BaseTestCase, Kristian?"
300300_1,,,,,,,"Hi Julien, please have a look on ./test/cpp/TestServer.cpp
It's doing exactly what you what to do but TFramedTransport is explicitly specified there."
1009498_1,,,,,,,It looks like HLog main has support to invoke --split.
1009498_2,,,,,,,Does it looks like if I call that on the log that it will put split it and put the data into the right place?
1009498_3,,,,,,,We had a handful of regionservers go OOM yesterday while a MR job was doing heavy writes to a column family that doesn't usually get them.
1009498_4,,,,,,,"In this case, the first OOM occurred here during writing the checksum."
982619_1,,,,,,,How about patch 2?
982619_2,,,,,,,"I added a ""."""
982619_3,,,,,,,to the end of the message.
982619_4,,,,,,,So we are sure how to parse it no matter how hadoop/platform changes.
1629869_1,,,,,,,"Hi Senaka,

That is exactly what I'd like to do, i.e., automatic download of CA cert and go ahead."
1629869_2,,,,,,,Is this possible?
1629869_3,,,,,,,"Frank
"
1320890_1,,,,,,,"Please have a look at the latest patch FELIX-3339_threaddump-as-inventoryprinter_FIXED.patch which correctly provides an InventoryPrinter implementation of Thread Dumper, have a look at the attached Screen Shot 2013-05-23 at 3.02.24 PM.pdf to see it in action embedded in the WebConsole."
1320890_2,,,,,,,I hope you'll like it!
1095817_1,,,,,,,The patch looks good and the tests pass +1.
1403474_1,,,,,,,"I agree there's a bug, I just want to ensure any change still works correctly when CURRENT_USER name is passed in."
1403474_2,,,,,,,My assertion is that the username passed into these routines (without any modification) is equivalent to value of an username identifier in the SQL language after it has been parsed by the SQL engine.
1403474_3,,,,,,,"This is also known as ""how it is stored in the SQL engine"" [JDBC]."
1403474_5,,,,,,,Note that though how users names are represented in the derby.
1403474_6,,,,,,,* properties may or may not match how a SQL engine would store them.
1403474_7,,,,,,,For historical reasons in some (all?)
1403474_8,,,,,,,cases the values in a derby.
1403474_9,,,,,,,"* property may be as a delimited identifier, e.g."
1403474_10,,,,,,,"""eVe""."
1403474_11,,,,,,,"Note that the Derby builtin users are not created through a SQL identifier in the SQL language, e.g."
1403474_12,,,,,,,in a CREATE USER statement.
1403474_13,,,,,,,"They are created by setting properties and are thus not ""stored in the SQL engine""."
593534_1,,,,,,,Does not appear to exist in trunk.
1497546_1,,,,,,,These blockers and critical issues are resolved but not verified.
1497546_2,,,,,,,Reporters of these issues please verify the fixes and help close these issues
1571661_1,,,,,,,I couldn't reproduce this.
1571661_4,,,,,,,"Ted, can you reproduce this outside of cassidy.pl?"
1643623_1,,,,,,,Thanks for the response.
1664747_1,x,,,,,,"Thanks a lot for sharing that, Josh!"
1664747_2,,,,,,,"I like the idea of making sure that things that should be specified should be passed as method parameters in one go, rather than through chaining, which makes it a lot harder to see what is required."
1664747_3,,,,,,,So I took the liberty of updating the patch to use requiredX/optionalX methods like in your code.
1664747_5,,,,,,,"Regarding Doug's points...

> But perhaps the preferred import should instead be 'import static SchemaBuilder.*'?"
1664747_6,,,,,,,The static methods have unique-enough names that this might work well.
1664747_8,,,,,,,Sounds good.
1664747_9,,,,,,,> We can convert from Java object to JsonNode by parsing the output of GenericData.toString(Object).
1664747_10,,,,,,,Thanks.
1664747_11,,,,,,,"I've updated the patch to do this, but it still needs tests for this part."
995004_3,,,,,,,"I'm thinking of multiple concurrent mutateRows operation, trying to lock the same set of rows."
995004_4,,,,,,,"Perhaps, throwing IOException is going to prevent us from a situation where we end up with a deadlock."
995004_5,,,,,,,"But, we still might want to sort it to ensure (better) progress (no livelock)."
1126952_1,,,,,,,"Unless I'm missing something, your patch doesn't actually change how the version is checked, only how it's computed."
1126952_2,,,,,,,"Did you intend to combine our patches, or is your patch incomplete?"
1427298_1,,,,,,,[bulk update] Close all resolved issues that haven't been updated for more than one year.
508238_1,,,,,,,- push out to 0.5
181726_1,,,,,,,A workaround for this issue is to use entity resolver.
181726_2,,,,,,,You may close this issue.
1719663_1,x,,,,,,Thanks a lot Subin.
1719663_2,,,,,,,"Also, when do you plan to take up AMBARI-1843 for adding the unit tests?"
1719663_3,,,,,,,We do not have to block this jira on the unit tests but we should probably try and get that in sooner than later.
1721286_1,,,,,,,Added patch to support configuration mapping
1456970_1,,,,,,,Wonky.
1456970_2,,,,,,,"Although as far as I see it, the bug here is that we allow the underscore after ""_design/"" not that we can't use filters from it."
424130_2,x,,,,,,"Brilliant feedback, thanks! I'm glad you found the issue, and the solution!"
367351_1,x,,,,,,Sweet :) You got there before me
639780_1,x,,,,,,bq. First of welcome :) Thank you. 
639780_2,x,,,,,,Thats sweet that you have the prior experience hacking this on top of a store already.
562912_1,x,,,,,,"Excellent work, Doğacan - thank you."
643148_1,x,,,,,,This looks simple and sweet to me.
355390_1,x,,,,,,Sweet kickstart for our new wiki!
527485_1,x,,,,,,"Hello,

Thanks a lot!

It works.
